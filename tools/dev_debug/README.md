# Dev Debug Quarantine

This folder contains non-canonical debugging and diagnostic workflows that were removed from the default deliverable path.

Contents:
- `scripts/`: ad-hoc diagnostics, sweeps, and exploratory qualitative scripts.
- `docs/`: debug notes.
- `assets/`: debug-only rendered figures.

Canonical deliverable scripts remain under `scripts/`:
- `scripts/run_demo.py`
- `scripts/make_triptych.py`
- `scripts/export_demo_assets.py`
